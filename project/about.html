            <h2>Iota Phi Theta Fraternity Inc.</h2>
            <p>
                Founded on September 19, 1963, during the height of the Civil Rights Movement, 
                Iota Phi Theta Fraternity, Incorporated was established by 12 visionary men at 
                Morgan State College with a commitment to scholarship, leadership, citizenship, 
                fidelity, and brotherhood. From its beginnings as a local fraternity, it has 
                grown into a national and international organization dedicated to making meaningful 
                contributions to society, particularly within the African-American community. 
                True to its founders’ vision, 
                Iota Phi Theta continues “Building a Tradition, Not Resting Upon One!”
