            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <h2>Iota Phi Theta Fraternity Inc.</h2>
            <p>
                Founded on September 19, 1963, during the height of the Civil Rights Movement, 
                Iota Phi Theta Fraternity, Incorporated was established by 12 visionary men at 
                Morgan State College with a commitment to scholarship, leadership, citizenship, 
                fidelity, and brotherhood. From its beginnings as a local fraternity, it has 
                grown into a national and international organization dedicated to making meaningful 
                contributions to society, particularly within the African-American community. 
                True to its founders’ vision, 
                Iota Phi Theta continues “Building a Tradition, Not Resting Upon One!”

            <h3>Mu Omega Chapter</h3>
            <p>
                Founded on June 18, 1982, by Joseph Little, Norman Robinson, Michael Wright, and Carl Mattox, 
                the East St. Louis Chapter proudly became the second graduate chapter in the Midwest region.
                 Since its founding, the chapter has been a driving force in the community, 
                supporting organizations such as St. Jude, Annie Malone, United Way, 
                Big Brothers & Big Sisters, and numerous local initiatives.
                 Through our dedication and service, we continue to advance our fraternity’s 
                 mission and positively impact the Metro East region.
